# Ticketsale-frontend
This project is a decentralized ticket sale and management application built on Ethereum. It leverages smart contracts to securely handle ticket transactions, swaps, and returns while ensuring transparency and immutability. The project includes a React.js-based frontend that interacts with the blockchain through web3.js.

#Features
#Purchase Tickets: Users can buy tickets securely by providing a ticket ID. Transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
#Offer Swaps: Ticket holders can propose a ticket swap by initiating an offer through the system.
#Accept Offers: Users can accept existing swap offers by providing the offer details.
#Retrieve Ticket Details: The application retrieves a user's ticket information using their wallet address.
#Return Tickets: Users can return their tickets if they no longer need them.

This project demonstrates a seamless integration of blockchain technology with a user-friendly interface, providing a secure and efficient way to manage tickets for events. It eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces fraud risks, and enhances trust in ticket sales and exchanges.

#Tech Stack:

#Frontend: React.js for the user interface.
#Backend: Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum.
#Blockchain Interaction: web3.js for communication between the frontend and the Ethereum network.
